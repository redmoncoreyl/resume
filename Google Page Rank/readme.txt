Compile: g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall -o webSearch

Run: ./webSearch

The data for the web is stored in the webpages.txt data file.
After the program is ran, the web needs to be preloaded, ranked,
and indexed before searches can be entered. This should take
about 13 seconds.

Enter single word searches when prompted. The result is a list
of ranked pages that contain the search.
